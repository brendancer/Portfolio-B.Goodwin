  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    In my previous life I was an elementary school teacher in Los Angeles, California. I came to Utah in 1998 looking
    for something new. I puchased a drivethrough coffee shop and spent the next 4 years operating it. My daughter came
    along (at age 45!) and I sold the coffee shop to became a stay-at-home mom.
  </p>
  <p>One of my passions is a community dance form called contra dance. I'm always on the wasatch Contras board and
    ususally president. We run a monthly dance series and annual weekends. When our webmaster decided to retire, I took
    the plunge and raised my hand.
  </p>
  <p>I watched some tutorials and learned basic Wordpress. I constructed a site for Wasatch Contras, a process I found
    very frustrating...and interesting! I was irritated by the constraints that I had under the Wordpress platform, so I
    decided to get a little deeper into coding and computers in general. I signed up for an online class from edX
    Harvard (CS50) and dived in. </p>
  <p>After successfully completing the course, I signed up for another and also a grahic
    design class through Shaw academy.
    I was loving the classes and progressing quickly, so I decided to get serious and enrolled in a full-stack
    development bootcamp through the University of Utah. I can't wait to apply my new skills in my second-act career!
